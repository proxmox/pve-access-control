  * api: user: limit the legacy user-keys option to the depreacated values
    that could be set in the first limited TFA system, like e.g., 'x!yubico'
    or base32 encoded secrets.

  * oidc: enforce generic URI regex for the ACR value to align with OIDC
    specifications and with Proxmox Backup Server, which was recently changed
    to actually be less strict.

  * LDAP sync: improve validation of synced attributes, closely limit the
    mapped attributes names and their values to avoid glitches through odd
    LDIF entries.

  * api: user: limit maximum length for first & last name to 1024 characters,
    email to 254 characters (the maximum actually useable in practice) and
    comment properties to 2048 characters. This avoid that a few single users
    bloat the user.cfg to much by mistake, reducing the total amount of users
    and ACLs that can be set up. Note that only users with User.Modify and
    realm syncs (setup by admins) can change these in the first place, so this
    is mostly to avoid mishaps and just to be sure.

    As, depending on the ACL object path, this privilege might allow one to
    change their own permissions, which was making the distinction between
    Admin and PVEAdmin irrelevant.

  * acls: restrict less-privileged ACL modifications. Through allocate
    permissions in pools, storages and virtual guests one can do some ACL
    modifications without having the Permissions.Modify privilege, lock those
    better down to ensure that one can only hand out only the subset of their
    own privileges, never more. Note that this is mostly future proofing, as
    the ACL object paths one could give out more permissions where already
    limiting the scope.

  * fix #4074: increase API OpenID code size limit to 2048

  * auth key: protect against rare chance of a double rotation in clusters,
    leaving the potential that some set of nodes have the earlier key cached,
    that then got rotated out due to the race, resulting in a possible other
    set of nodes having the newer key cached. This is a split view of the auth
    key and may resulting in spurious failures if API requests are made to a
    different node than the ticket was generated on.
    In addition to that, the "keep validity of old tickets if signed in the
    last two hours before rotation" logic was disabled too in such a case,
    making such tickets invalid too early.
    Note that both are cases where Proxmox VE was too strict, so while this
    had no security implications it can be a nuisance, especially for
    environments that use the API through an automated or scripted way
